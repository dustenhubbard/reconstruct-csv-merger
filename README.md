# Reconstruct-CSV-Merger
This is a tool designed for taking Reconstruct exported lists (Objects, Traces, Z-traces) and merging them into a unique dendrite sheet/tab in an excel file.

The consistent naming scheme that must be followed for the program to work:
  SERIES_d##objects.csv
  SERIES_d##traces.csv
  SERIES_d##ztraces.csv
